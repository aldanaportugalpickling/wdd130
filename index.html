                <p>Hello, my name is Aldana Andrea Portugal Pickling. I am from Iquitos, Peru, and I am 21 years old. I love animals, especially cats. I like drawing, cooking, and going to the gym. I am studying software development because I am passionate about technology and creating practical solutions. I value empathy and collaboration, and I always strive to help others. In my free time, I offer advice on how to overcome anxiety, as I have been through those moments and I am in the process of overcoming it. I enjoy providing support to those who need it. I have learned various techniques to manage stress and anxiety, such as meditation, deep breathing, and the practice of mindfulness. Additionally, I apply emotional shock therapy, where I constantly face my fears with courage to eliminate anxiety. I believe it is essential to share these experiences and knowledge to help others find their way to tranquility and emotional well-being. Knowing that I can make a difference in someone else's life is one of the greatest rewards I can experience. I believe that continuous learning is key to personal and professional growth, so I frequently participate in workshops and online courses. I am always excited to meet new people and exchange ideas, as I believe that different perspectives help me grow. Ultimately, my goal is to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
