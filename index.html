            <p>Hello, my name is Aldana Andrea Portugal Pickling. I am from Iquitos, Peru, and I am 21 years old. I love animals, especially cats. I like drawing, cooking, and going to the gym. I am studying software development because I am passionate about technology and creating practical solutions. I value empathy and collaboration, and I always strive to help others. In my free time, I offer advice on how to overcome anxiety, as I have been through those moments and I am in the process of overcoming it. I enjoy providing support to those who need it. I have learned various techniques to manage stress and anxiety, such as meditation, deep breathing, and the practice of mindfulness. Additionally, I apply emotional shock therapy, where I constantly face my fears with courage to eliminate anxiety. I believe it is essential to share these experiences and knowledge to help others find their way to tranquility and emotional well-being. Knowing that I can make a difference in someone else's life is one of the greatest rewards I can experience. I believe that continuous learning is key to personal and professional growth, so I frequently participate in workshops and online courses. I am always excited to meet new people and exchange ideas, as I believe that different perspectives help me grow. Ultimately, my goal is to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

            <p>Iquitos is the capital of the Loreto department, in the northwest of Peru, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. It is the largest city in the world that cannot be accessed by road, only via river or air. Founded during the rubber boom, its architectural heritage includes iconic buildings such as the Iron House. At the heart of Iquitos lies the Plaza de Armas, a central square surrounded by beautiful colonial buildings and vibrant daily activities. It is an important cultural, economic, and tourist center, famous for its exotic cuisine and vibrant nightlife. Iquitos is the gateway to the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve, a protected area of tremendous biodiversity. Visitors can explore its fascinating fauna and flora, as well as enjoy its lively markets and local festivities.</p>
